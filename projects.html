        <p class="about">Below is a list of some projects that I have worked on since joining the CTAC program. The Recipe Website is a website for grilled cheese recipe. The home page explains why I think grilled cheese is the <strong>ultimate</strong> comfort food. It also has links to the directions page and the ingredients page. The Nav Bar project shows a navigation bar for a website. The words in the bar are not link to anypages but can be. I was also able to add a search bar and some icons. The last link is the first website I made with just using HTML. It is a simple website about our moon and has a link to a website with facts about the moon!
